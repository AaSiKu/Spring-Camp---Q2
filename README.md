+ `'Question-2.ipynb'` contains the code for the encoder-decoder model it takes a `(256,256,3)` image as input , identifies the most important features and tries to recreate the original image using those features.
+ The model has been trained for about 2000 epochs.
+ To utilize the full benifit of the model I have also provided the optimized weights in `'Question2_saved_weights.h5'`.I hope this will be usefull

Looking forward to participate in Spring Camp ðŸ˜„
